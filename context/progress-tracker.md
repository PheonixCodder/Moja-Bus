# Progress Tracker

**Update this file after every completed feature.** Any agent reading this should immediately know what is done, what is in progress, and what is next.

## Current Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Phase** | Passenger Booking + Operator Operations (late MVP) |
| **Last major milestone** | Paystack payments + HoldGroup aggregate + ledger (2026-07-05) |
| **Web unit tests** | 47 passing (`pnpm test` in `apps/web`) |
| **Next priority** | Paystack test-mode validation → admin commission UI → dashboard polish |

### What works end-to-end today

- **Passenger:** Search on `/` → book seats → per-seat passengers → **Paystack card/MoMo** → digital ticket + public `/tickets/[token]` page → dashboard bookings/tickets
- **Operator:** Onboarding → fleet/routes/schedules → dispatch board → manifest (segment occupancy, check-in, QR scanner) → bookings list
- **Auth:** Email/password, Google, OTP verify, password reset (passenger + operator)

### Known gaps (not blocking dev/demo)

- Paystack live keys required for real charges (`PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY`)
- Admin commission tier UI not built (tRPC API under `payments.*` exists)
- Passenger dashboard home stats hardcoded `"0"`
- `/dashboard/search` is a placeholder shell (real search lives on `/`)
- Operator revenue analytics placeholder
- No admin verification queue UI
- Mobile app: shell only, no passenger search/booking
- `trip.bookedSeats` DB column unused (occupancy derived from bookings)
- Pre-existing TypeScript noise in some operator views / `bank-crypto.ts` / `trip-generator.ts`

## Decision Log (unchanged)

### Product
1. **Moja Ride** — CI intercity bus marketplace + operator ERP
2. Commission-based revenue; Mobile Money primary payment target
3. Apps: Passenger Web (live), Operator Portal (live), Mobile (shell), Admin (planned)
4. QR digital tickets with offline access goal on mobile

### Technical
1. Monorepo: Turbo + pnpm
2. Web: Next.js 16, tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Better Auth, Tailwind 4 + shadcn
3. Mobile: Expo SDK 56 + NativeWind
4. Segment occupancy derived from bookings — **not** `trip.bookedSeats`
5. Booking snapshots: `passengerName` / `passengerPhone` on each `Booking` row at hold time
6. Multi-seat holds grouped by `holdGroupId` (legacy: phone + trip + expiry)

### Deferred (v2+)
Agent app, driver app, multi-country, cargo, subscriptions, loyalty, public API

## Recommended Next Steps (priority order)

### 1. Real payment provider (highest product impact)
Wire **one** live gateway first (recommend **CinetPay** or **Wave** for CI Mobile Money):
- Provider adapter behind existing `PaymentService` registry
- Webhook route for async confirmation
- Replace mock-only path in checkout success criteria
- Keep mock provider for local dev

### 2. Passenger dashboard polish (quick wins)
- Wire `dashboard-view.tsx` stats from `booking.listMyBookings` (upcoming count, ticket count)
- Redirect `/dashboard/search` → `/` or embed `SearchPageClient`
- Call `passenger.ensureProfile` on passenger layout mount (faster checkout defaults)

### 3. Operator revenue & analytics
- Basic KPIs: bookings today, revenue XOF (sum `farePaid`), occupancy rate
- Replace placeholder operator dashboard stats

### 4. Admin verification queue
- List `PENDING_VERIFICATION` companies + document review
- Approve/reject with reason → operator status transitions
- Unblocks real operator go-live

### 5. Booking ownership hardening
- Decide: keep silent phone lazy-claim vs explicit phone + OTP
- Document choice in `context/architecture.md`

### 6. Performance & hardening
- Redis cache for `search.search` (optional until traffic)
- Fix pre-existing TypeScript errors (`bank-crypto`, `trip-generator`, operator mutation types)
- E2E smoke test script for book → pay → ticket → operator check-in

### 7. Mobile passenger MVP
- Port search + booking flow to Expo (reuse tRPC client)
- Offline ticket storage

## Blockers & Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Payment gateway API complexity | Start with one provider; mock stays for dev |
| Seat race conditions | Already using DB transactions + overlap checks |
| Operator adoption | Admin verification + clear onboarding ROI |
| Stale progress docs | Update this file after each milestone |

---

## Success Criteria (MVP)

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Operators onboarded | 5+ | Dev/staging only |
| Registered passengers | 100+ | Not tracked |
| Completed bookings | 100+ | Dev testing |
| Booking success rate | 90%+ | Not measured |
| Unit tests (web) | Green | 43 passing |
